   - The text on the left side of the road near the sidewalk is partially visible and appears to be on a box or a similar object.

2. **Extract and Analyze Text Content:**
   - The text on the road sign at the top is not clearly visible, so it cannot be extracted or analyzed.
   - The text on the box near the sidewalk is partially visible and appears to be related to a product or advertisement. However, the text is not fully legible, and it is not clear if it is related to personal affairs or public affairs.

3. **Determine Relevance:**
   - Since the text on the road sign is not visible, it cannot be determined if it is related to public affairs or personal affairs.
   - The text on the box near the sidewalk is not fully legible, and it is not clear if it is related to personal affairs or public affairs. Therefore, it is not possible to determine its relevance.

### Explanation:
The speed limit sign is a standard road sign related to transportation and public affairs. The other sign on the left side of the road is not a standard road sign and is not relevant to the task. Therefore, the overall result is ""no"" as the primary content is related to public affairs.","Role: You are an intelligent assistant with the ability to recognize road signs or billboards. You can accurately extract and analyze the text content.
    Task: Please identify the signs or billboards on the road (please note that this refers to the road itself, not the buildings along the road. If the sign is a common one on the buildings, please ignore it!) 。 If the text content can be extracted, please determine whether it is related to ""public affairs"" or ""personal affairs"":
    Vocabulary related to ""personal affairs"" includes: ""Welcome to **"", ""Advertisement of **"", ""Car maintenance of **"", ""Recruitment of **"", etc.
    Vocabulary related to ""public affairs"" includes: 1) Vocabulary related to ""transportation"" (such as ""Maximum load of ** tons"", ""Prohibition of **"", ""Drunk driving of **"", ""Transportation of **"", ""Drive **"", ""Fasten seat belt"", ""Section of **"", ""Be careful of **"", etc.);
    2) Place names (such as Beijing, Shanghai, Xicheng District, Yao Guantun, Huangcun, etc.);
    3) Indicative words (such as ""** parking lot"", ""** gas station"", etc.)
    Note: There may be annotation texts related to road names in the upper left corner of the picture. These are irrelevant to the recognition task, so please ignore them! Do not recognize them as the text on the sign! If the text in the picture is difficult to recognize due to the shooting angle, lighting, or blurriness, or if you are unsure whether the text comes from an unofficial source, please reply ""no"" in all cases.
    Output: First, provide the analysis process. Additionally, if the text is of personal affairs nature, please return:

```","Role: You are an intelligent assistant with the ability to accurately identify road occupation/digging activities in images.
    Task: Please analyze this image and determine if any vehicles are currently engaged in road occupation/digging activities.
    Firstly, you need to determine if there are any **large stationary vehicles** (such as construction trucks, engineering vehicles, excavators, etc.) in the image. Ignore vehicles that are moving normally or waiting to pass.
    Then, determine if these **stationary large vehicles** are in a construction operation state, including but not limited to:
    - The vehicle body is tilted, is unloading or loading;
    - The digging arm or bucket is in operation;
    - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device has physical contact with the road surface;
    - There are obvious construction signs or construction obstacles (such as fences, cones, earth mounds, etc.) that are in line with the construction behavior;
    - Personnel are interacting with the vehicle, operating it, or directing the operation. Ignore the following interfering content: normal vehicle movement, vehicle parked in a safe area but without construction activities, buildings, pedestrians, toll stations, dividers, etc.

1. **Identify Items on the Road:**
   - The image shows a road intersection with vehicles, including a yellow truck and a white van.
   - The yellow truck is carrying items on its flatbed, but these items are securely placed on the truck and not on the road itself.

2. **Check for Stacked Items:**
   - There are no visible items stacked or placed directly on the road surface. All items are either on vehicles or within the boundaries of the vehicles.

3. **Consider Potential Stacking:**
   - The items on the truck are part of its load and are not considered as being ""stacked on the road"" since they are on the vehicle.

    Firstly, you need to determine if there are any **large stationary vehicles** (such as construction trucks, engineering vehicles, excavators, etc.) in the image. Ignore vehicles that are moving normally or waiting to pass.
    Then, determine if these **stationary large vehicles** are in a construction operation state, including but not limited to:
    - The vehicle body is tilted, is unloading or loading;
    - The digging arm or bucket is in operation;
    - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device has physical contact with the road surface;
    - There are obvious construction signs or construction obstacles (such as fences, cones, earth mounds, etc.) that are in line with the construction behavior;
    - Personnel are interacting with the vehicle, operating it, or directing the operation. Ignore the following interfering content: normal vehicle movement, vehicle parked in a safe area but without construction activities, buildings, pedestrians, toll stations, dividers, etc.
    If the image is blurry, the view is obstructed, or there is severe lack of light, making it impossible to accurately determine, please reply ""no"".

   - There are people visible near the stalls, which could be vendors or customers. However, it is not clear from the image whether these individuals are actively engaged in selling activities or are just passing by.

3. **Road Usage**:
   - The stalls are located on the sidewalk and do not appear to be directly on the road. However, they are close to the road and could potentially encroach on the road area.

4. **Stall Setup**:
   - The structures have a setup that is consistent with roadside selling, including coverings and what appears to be merchandise or goods displayed.

### Conclusion:
While there are signs of roadside selling with the presence of stalls and people, it is not clear whether the individuals are actively engaged in selling activities. Additionally, the stalls are not directly on the road but on the sidewalk.

1. **Identify Large Stationary Vehicles:**
   - There are no large stationary vehicles such as construction trucks, engineering vehicles, or excavators visible in the image. The vehicles present appear to be regular cars and a few smaller vehicles, none of which are large enough to be considered construction vehicles.

2. **Check for Construction Operation State:**
   - Since there are no large stationary vehicles, there is no need to check for construction operation states such as unloading/loading, digging arms in operation, or mechanical arms contacting the road surface.

3. **Look for Construction Signs or Obstacles:**
   - There are some traffic cones and personnel in safety vests, which might suggest some form of road activity. However, these are not sufficient to indicate road occupation/digging activities by large vehicles.

4. **Check for Personnel Interaction:**

   - The image shows a road with a billboard on the left side. The billboard is mounted on a pole and appears to be illuminated. However, the text on the billboard is not clearly visible due to the angle and lighting conditions.

2. **Text Extraction and Recognition:**  
   - The text on the billboard is not legible in this image. The content is too blurry to extract any meaningful text.

3. **Determine Relevance:**  
   - Since the text on the billboard is not readable, it is impossible to determine if it is related to ""public affairs"" or ""personal affairs.""

4. **Consider Road Name Annotations:**  
   - The text in the upper left corner of the image is related to the road name and is not part of the sign or billboard. Therefore, it is irrelevant to the task.

1. **Identify the Road Area**: The road area is clearly visible in the image, with two lanes separated by a yellow and black striped barrier. The road is bordered by greenery on both sides.

2. **Look for Stacked Items**: 
   - There are no visible items stacked on the road surface itself. The road appears clear of any objects that are not part of the infrastructure (like guardrails or road markings).
   - There are two trucks visible in the image. One is on the road, and the other is on the side of the road. Both trucks have items on them, but these items are on the trucks, not on the road.

3. **Check for Ambiguity**: 
   - The items on the trucks are securely placed on the trucks and do not extend onto the road surface. There is no indication that these items are being stacked on the road.

1. **Identify the Road Area**: The road area is clearly visible in the image, with vehicles traveling on it. The road is bordered by a fence on the left and trees on the right.

2. **Look for Stacked Items**: 
   - The vehicles on the road are not considered as stacked items since they are in motion or parked as part of normal traffic.
   - There are no visible piles of items on the road surface itself. The road appears clear of any objects that are not vehicles.

3. **Check for Items on Vehicles**:
   - There are no items visibly stacked on top of the vehicles. The vehicles appear to be carrying their usual loads, and there are no signs of additional items being piled on them.

4. **Consider Other Road Areas**:
   - The sidewalks and areas adjacent to the road do not show any items piled up either.

    Firstly, you need to determine if there are any **large stationary vehicles** (such as construction trucks, engineering vehicles, excavators, etc.) in the image. Ignore vehicles that are moving normally or waiting to pass.
    Then, determine if these **stationary large vehicles** are in a construction operation state, including but not limited to:
    - The vehicle body is tilted, is unloading or loading;
    - The digging arm or bucket is in operation;
    - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device has physical contact with the road surface;
    - There are obvious construction signs or construction obstacles (such as fences, cones, earth mounds, etc.) that are in line with the construction behavior;

1. **Identify Road Signs and Billboards:**
   - The image shows a road intersection with traffic lights, road markings, and a few signs. The signs are small and not very clear, but they appear to be standard road signs rather than billboards.

2. **Text Extraction:**
   - There is no visible text on the road signs that can be clearly extracted. The signs appear to be standard symbols or markings rather than text-based signs.

3. **Determine Relevance:**
   - Since there is no clear text on the signs, it is not possible to determine if the content is related to ""public affairs"" or ""personal affairs.""

4. **Consider Road Name Annotations:**
   - The text in the upper left corner appears to be an annotation related to the road name and is not part of the signs on the road. This should be ignored as per the instructions.

    Task: Please analyze this image and determine if any vehicles are currently engaged in road occupation/digging activities.
    Firstly, you need to determine if there are any **large stationary vehicles** (such as construction trucks, engineering vehicles, excavators, etc.) in the image. Ignore vehicles that are moving normally or waiting to pass.
    Then, determine if these **stationary large vehicles** are in a construction operation state, including but not limited to:
    - The vehicle body is tilted, is unloading or loading;
    - The digging arm or bucket is in operation;
    - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device has physical contact with the road surface;
    - There are obvious construction signs or construction obstacles (such as fences, cones, earth mounds, etc.) that are in line with the construction behavior;
    - Personnel are interacting with the vehicle, operating it, or directing the operation. Ignore the following interfering content: normal vehicle movement, vehicle parked in a safe area but without construction activities, buildings, pedestrians, toll stations, dividers, etc.

1. **Identify the Road Area**: The road area includes the lanes, crosswalks, and any other paved surfaces intended for vehicles and pedestrians.

2. **Look for Stacked Items**: Focus on identifying any objects that are placed or stacked on the road area, excluding vehicles, pedestrians, guardrails, utility poles, and road obstacles.

3. **Examine Vehicles**: Check if any items are stacked on or within the vehicles. If items are on a vehicle, they are not considered as being on the road.

4. **Check Surrounding Areas**: Ensure there are no items placed on the road outside of vehicles.

### Analysis:

- The image shows a road intersection with vehicles, including trucks and cars.
- There are no visible items stacked directly on the road surface outside of the vehicles.
- The items on the green truck are within the truck's trailer and not on the road.
- The white truck is also carrying items within its container, which is not on the road.

### Conclusion:

There are no items piled up on the road or within the road area outside of vehicles.

    Then, determine if these **stationary large vehicles** are in a construction operation state, including but not limited to:
    - The vehicle body is tilted, is unloading or loading;
    - The digging arm or bucket is in operation;
    - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device has physical contact with the road surface;
    - There are obvious construction signs or construction obstacles (such as fences, cones, earth mounds, etc.) that are in line with the construction behavior;

1. **Identify Large Stationary Vehicles:**
   - There are no large stationary vehicles visible in the image. The scene shows a road with a person standing near some cones and a light source, but no construction trucks, excavators, or similar vehicles are present.

2. **Check for Construction Operation State:**
   - Since there are no large stationary vehicles, there is no need to check for construction operation states such as unloading/loading, digging arms in operation, or mechanical arms contacting the road surface.

3. **Identify Construction Signs or Obstacles:**
   - There are some traffic cones and a light source, which could indicate some form of road activity. However, these alone do not confirm the presence of a large vehicle engaged in road occupation/digging activities.

4. **Personnel Interaction:**
   - There is a person standing near the cones and light source, but they are not interacting with any large vehicle. This suggests that the person might be directing or monitoring something, but it is not clear if it is related to road occupation/digging.

5. **Image Clarity and Lighting:**
   - The image is clear enough to identify the elements present, and there is sufficient light to analyze the scene.

1. **Identify Road Signs/Billboards:**
   - The image contains several signs and billboards. The focus is on those located on the road itself, not on buildings.

2. **Extract Text Content:**
   - The billboard on the left side of the road contains the text: ""更受年轻人喜欢的中国能量饮料"" (More popular among young people, Chinese energy drink).
   - The billboard on the right side of the road contains the text: ""中华 为中华健儿干杯"" (Cheers to the Chinese athletes).

3. **Determine Nature of Content:**
   - The text on the left billboard is an advertisement for an energy drink, which is related to personal affairs.
   - The text on the right billboard is a slogan, which could be considered promotional but does not fit neatly into either category. However, it leans more towards personal affairs as it is not directly related to public transportation or official matters.

4. **Bounding Boxes:**
   - The left billboard is located at coordinates approximately [150, 250, 700, 350] on a 1000x1000 scale.

1. **Identify Road Area**: The image shows a multi-lane road with vehicles, guardrails, and road markings. The road area is clearly defined by the lanes and the surrounding infrastructure.

2. **Look for Stacked Items**: 
   - The road is mostly clear, with only vehicles present.
   - There are no visible items stacked on the road surface or within the road area.
   - The vehicles are on the road, but they are not considered as ""stacked items"" as per the instructions.

3. **Check for Ambiguities**:
   - There are no objects that could be mistaken for stacked items.
   - The guardrails, road signs, and other infrastructure are not considered as stacked items.

### Conclusion:
There are no items piled up on the road or within the road area. The road is clear except for the vehicles.

### Output:

1. **Identify Road Area**: The image shows a multi-lane road with vehicles, guardrails, and traffic lights. The road area is clearly defined by the lanes and the surrounding infrastructure.

2. **Look for Stacked Items**: The focus is on identifying any items that are stacked or placed on the road itself, not on vehicles or other objects. The road appears clear of any such items.

3. **Check for Ambiguities**: There are no visible objects that could be mistaken for stacked items. The road surface is clean, and the lanes are unobstructed.

4. **Consider Vehicles**: The vehicles on the road are carrying items, but these items are on the vehicles, not on the road. Therefore, they do not qualify as stacked items on the road.

### Conclusion:

There are no items stacked or placed on the road or within the road area. All items are either on vehicles or part of the road infrastructure.

1. **Identify Road Signs/Billboards:**
   - The image contains several signs and billboards. The focus is on those directly related to the road itself, not the buildings.
   - The signs on the road include:
     - A red and yellow billboard with text about a beverage.
     - A billboard with text about a specific brand of alcohol.

2. **Text Extraction and Categorization:**
