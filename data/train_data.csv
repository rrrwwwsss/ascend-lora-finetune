    Task: Please analyze this image and determine if any vehicles are currently engaged in road occupation/digging activities.
    Firstly, you need to determine if there are any **large stationary vehicles** (such as construction trucks, engineering vehicles, excavators, etc.) in the image. Ignore vehicles that are moving normally or waiting to pass.
    Then, determine if these **stationary large vehicles** are in a construction operation state, including but not limited to:
    - The vehicle body is tilted, is unloading or loading;
    - The digging arm or bucket is in operation;
    - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device has physical contact with the road surface;
    - There are obvious construction signs or construction obstacles (such as fences, cones, earth mounds, etc.) that are in line with the construction behavior;
    - Personnel are interacting with the vehicle, operating it, or directing the operation. Ignore the following interfering content: normal vehicle movement, vehicle parked in a safe area but without construction activities, buildings, pedestrians, toll stations, dividers, etc.

1. **Identify the Road Area**: The road area is clearly visible, with lanes separated by white lines and a central divider. The focus is on the road surface and its immediate surroundings.

2. **Look for Stacked Items**: 
   - **Vehicles**: There are vehicles on the road, including a red truck on the right side. However, the items on the truck are not on the road but on the vehicle itself.
   - **Pedestrians and Objects**: There are no pedestrians or objects visibly stacked on the road surface.
   - **Road Obstacles**: The central divider and guardrails are part of the road infrastructure and not considered as stacked items.

3. **Check for Any Unusual Items**: There are no unusual items or objects that appear to be stacked on the road surface. Everything visible is either part of the road infrastructure or on vehicles.

1. **Identify Road Signs:**
   - The image contains two circular road signs on the right side of the road. 
   - The first sign indicates a ""15t"" limit, which is a weight restriction for vehicles.
   - The second sign indicates a ""10t"" limit, which is likely a weight restriction for a specific type of vehicle or axle.

2. **Determine the Nature of the Text:**
   - The text ""15t"" and ""10t"" is related to transportation and public affairs, as it specifies weight limits for vehicles, which is a common traffic regulation.

3. **Check for Personal Affairs Vocabulary:**
   - There is no text related to personal affairs such as advertisements, car maintenance, or recruitment.

4. **Ignore Annotation Text:**
   - The text in the upper left corner is an annotation and not part of the road signs, so it is ignored.

3. **Check for Items on Vehicles**: There is a vehicle on the right side of the road. The vehicle appears to be carrying items, but these items are on the vehicle and not on the road itself.

4. **Consider Other Elements**: There are no pedestrians, guardrails, utility poles, or road obstacles that could be mistaken for stacked items on the road.

### Conclusion:

Since the items are on the vehicle and not on the road, and there are no other items stacked or placed on the road, the result is:

1. **Identify Road Signs and Billboards:**
   - The image contains several road signs and a billboard. The signs are located on poles and the billboard is on the right side of the road.

2. **Extract Text Content:**
   - The road signs appear to have text, but the resolution and angle make it difficult to extract the exact content. The billboard on the right side has some text, but it is not clear enough to read.

3. **Determine Relevance:**
   - The signs on the road are likely related to transportation or public affairs, as they are placed in a manner typical for traffic control or information. The billboard, however, is not clearly legible and may not be related to public affairs.

4. **Decision Based on Clarity and Relevance:**
   - Since the text on the signs is not clearly legible and the billboard's content is uncertain, it is safer to assume that the signs are related to public affairs (transportation) and the billboard is not relevant.

1. **Identify Road Signs or Billboards:**
   - The image shows a road with various elements, including a road sign on the left side near the sidewalk. This sign appears to be a common road sign, but its text is not clearly visible due to the resolution and angle.

2. **Text Extraction and Recognition:**
   - The text on the road sign is not legible in the image. The resolution and angle make it difficult to extract any meaningful content from the sign.

3. **Determine Relevance:**
   - Since the text on the sign is not clearly visible, it is not possible to determine if it is related to ""public affairs"" or ""personal affairs."" Therefore, it is safer to assume that the text is not relevant for the given task.

1. **Identify Large Stationary Vehicles:**
   - There is a large vehicle visible on the right side of the image. It appears to be a construction or utility truck.

2. **Determine if the Vehicle is in a Construction Operation State:**
   - **Vehicle Body Tilt/Unloading/Loading:** The vehicle does not appear to be tilted, and there is no visible unloading or loading activity.
   - **Digging Arm/Bucket Operation:** There is no visible digging arm or bucket in operation.
   - **Mechanical Arm/Road Contact:** There is no visible mechanical arm or fixed device in contact with the road surface.
   - **Construction Signs/Obstacles:** There are orange traffic cones placed around the vehicle, which are typical construction obstacles. However, these alone do not confirm active construction.
   - **Personnel Interaction:** There are no visible personnel interacting with the vehicle or directing operations.

3. **Consider Interfering Content:**
   - The vehicle is parked in a safe area near the side of the road, and there is no clear evidence of ongoing construction activities.

   - There are no items visibly stacked on the road surface itself. The road appears clear of any objects that are not part of the infrastructure.
   - There is a truck on the left side of the road, and it is carrying a load of items (possibly bricks or similar materials). However, these items are on the truck and not on the road.

3. **Check for Other Possible Stacking**:
   - No other objects or items are seen stacked on the road or within the road area. The road is free of any debris or obstacles that could be considered as stacked items.

### Conclusion:
Since the items are on the truck and not on the road, and there are no other items stacked on the road, the result is:

```","Role: You are an intelligent assistant with the ability to accurately identify road occupation/digging activities in images.
    Task: Please analyze this image and determine if any vehicles are currently engaged in road occupation/digging activities.
    Firstly, you need to determine if there are any **large stationary vehicles** (such as construction trucks, engineering vehicles, excavators, etc.) in the image. Ignore vehicles that are moving normally or waiting to pass.
    Then, determine if these **stationary large vehicles** are in a construction operation state, including but not limited to:
    - The vehicle body is tilted, is unloading or loading;
    - The digging arm or bucket is in operation;
    - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device has physical contact with the road surface;
    - There are obvious construction signs or construction obstacles (such as fences, cones, earth mounds, etc.) that are in line with the construction behavior;
    - Personnel are interacting with the vehicle, operating it, or directing the operation. Ignore the following interfering content: normal vehicle movement, vehicle parked in a safe area but without construction activities, buildings, pedestrians, toll stations, dividers, etc.
    If the image is blurry, the view is obstructed, or there is severe lack of light, making it impossible to accurately determine, please reply ""no"".

    Then, determine if these **stationary large vehicles** are in a construction operation state, including but not limited to:
    - The vehicle body is tilted, is unloading or loading;
    - The digging arm or bucket is in operation;
    - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device has physical contact with the road surface;
    - There are obvious construction signs or construction obstacles (such as fences, cones, earth mounds, etc.) that are in line with the construction behavior;
    - Personnel are interacting with the vehicle, operating it, or directing the operation. Ignore the following interfering content: normal vehicle movement, vehicle parked in a safe area but without construction activities, buildings, pedestrians, toll stations, dividers, etc.
    If the image is blurry, the view is obstructed, or there is severe lack of light, making it impossible to accurately determine, please reply ""no"".
Output :Firstly, the analysis process is presented. Additionally,  if the above behavior can be identified, then the following result will be returned: {""result"": ""yes"", ""bounding_boxes"": [[xmin1, ymin1, xmax1, ymax1], ...]}, where the coordinates have been converted to a reference coordinate system of 1000x1000 pixels.

    Then, determine if these **stationary large vehicles** are in a construction operation state, including but not limited to:
    - The vehicle body is tilted, is unloading or loading;
    - The digging arm or bucket is in operation;
    - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device has physical contact with the road surface;
    - There are obvious construction signs or construction obstacles (such as fences, cones, earth mounds, etc.) that are in line with the construction behavior;
    - Personnel are interacting with the vehicle, operating it, or directing the operation. Ignore the following interfering content: normal vehicle movement, vehicle parked in a safe area but without construction activities, buildings, pedestrians, toll stations, dividers, etc.
    If the image is blurry, the view is obstructed, or there is severe lack of light, making it impossible to accurately determine, please reply ""no"".
Output :Firstly, the analysis process is presented. Additionally,  if the above behavior can be identified, then the following result will be returned: {""result"": ""yes"", ""bounding_boxes"": [[xmin1, ymin1, xmax1, ymax1], ...]}, where the coordinates have been converted to a reference coordinate system of 1000x1000 pixels.

1. **Identify Large Stationary Vehicles:**
   - There is a large yellow vehicle visible on the left side of the image, near the bridge. It appears to be a construction vehicle, possibly a crane or excavator.

2. **Determine if the Vehicle is in a Construction Operation State:**
   - The vehicle body is not tilted, and there is no visible unloading or loading activity.
   - There is no digging arm or bucket in operation.
   - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device does not appear to have physical contact with the road surface.
   - There are construction cones placed along the road, indicating a construction zone, but the vehicle itself is not directly interacting with the road surface.
   - There are no visible personnel interacting with the vehicle or directing the operation.

3. **Consider Other Factors:**
   - The road is partially blocked by cones, suggesting a construction activity, but the vehicle in question does not appear to be actively engaged in road occupation or digging at this moment.

    - The digging arm or bucket is in operation;
    - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device has physical contact with the road surface;
    - There are obvious construction signs or construction obstacles (such as fences, cones, earth mounds, etc.) that are in line with the construction behavior;
    - Personnel are interacting with the vehicle, operating it, or directing the operation. Ignore the following interfering content: normal vehicle movement, vehicle parked in a safe area but without construction activities, buildings, pedestrians, toll stations, dividers, etc.

    Task: Please analyze this image and determine if any vehicles are currently engaged in road occupation/digging activities.
    Firstly, you need to determine if there are any **large stationary vehicles** (such as construction trucks, engineering vehicles, excavators, etc.) in the image. Ignore vehicles that are moving normally or waiting to pass.
    Then, determine if these **stationary large vehicles** are in a construction operation state, including but not limited to:
    - The vehicle body is tilted, is unloading or loading;
    - The digging arm or bucket is in operation;
    - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device has physical contact with the road surface;
    - There are obvious construction signs or construction obstacles (such as fences, cones, earth mounds, etc.) that are in line with the construction behavior;
    - Personnel are interacting with the vehicle, operating it, or directing the operation. Ignore the following interfering content: normal vehicle movement, vehicle parked in a safe area but without construction activities, buildings, pedestrians, toll stations, dividers, etc.
    If the image is blurry, the view is obstructed, or there is severe lack of light, making it impossible to accurately determine, please reply ""no"".

1. **Identify Road Signs and Billboards:**
   - The image shows a road with various elements, including a road sign on the left side near the sidewalk. The sign appears to be a common road sign, but the text is not clearly visible due to the angle and distance.

2. **Text Extraction and Recognition:**
   - The text on the sign is not legible due to the image resolution and angle. Therefore, it is not possible to extract the text content accurately.

3. **Determine Relevance:**
   - Since the text on the sign is not clearly visible, it is not possible to determine whether it is related to ""public affairs"" or ""personal affairs.""

4. **Decision:**
   - Given the lack of clear text and the inability to determine its relevance, the appropriate response is to indicate that the text cannot be recognized.

   - There are no large stationary vehicles such as construction trucks, engineering vehicles, or excavators visible in the image. The only vehicle present is a motorcycle parked on the side of the road, which is not a large vehicle and is not engaged in any construction activity.

2. **Check for Construction Operation State:**
   - Since there are no large stationary vehicles, there is no need to check for any construction operation states such as unloading/loading, digging arm operation, or mechanical arm contact with the road surface.

3. **Identify Construction Signs or Obstacles:**
   - There are construction signs and obstacles present, such as fences, cones, and earth mounds. However, these are not associated with any large stationary vehicles.

4. **Personnel Interaction:**
   - There are personnel present, but they are not interacting with any large vehicles. They appear to be walking near the construction area.

5. **Image Clarity:**
   - The image is clear, and there are no obstructions or lack of light that would prevent accurate determination.

    Task: Please analyze this image and determine if any vehicles are currently engaged in road occupation/digging activities.
    Firstly, you need to determine if there are any **large stationary vehicles** (such as construction trucks, engineering vehicles, excavators, etc.) in the image. Ignore vehicles that are moving normally or waiting to pass.
    Then, determine if these **stationary large vehicles** are in a construction operation state, including but not limited to:
    - The vehicle body is tilted, is unloading or loading;
    - The digging arm or bucket is in operation;
    - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device has physical contact with the road surface;
    - There are obvious construction signs or construction obstacles (such as fences, cones, earth mounds, etc.) that are in line with the construction behavior;
    - Personnel are interacting with the vehicle, operating it, or directing the operation. Ignore the following interfering content: normal vehicle movement, vehicle parked in a safe area but without construction activities, buildings, pedestrians, toll stations, dividers, etc.

1. **Identify Large Stationary Vehicles:**
   - There is a large vehicle visible in the image, specifically a truck with a flatbed trailer. It is stationary and appears to be parked on the side of the road.

2. **Determine if the Vehicle is in a Construction Operation State:**
   - **Vehicle Body Tilt or Unloading/Loading:** The truck's flatbed trailer is tilted, and there is visible material (possibly sand or soil) being unloaded onto the road. This indicates that the vehicle is actively engaged in unloading.
   - **Digging Arm or Bucket Operation:** There is no visible digging arm or bucket in operation.
   - **Mechanical Arm or Fixed Device Contact with Road Surface:** There is no visible mechanical arm or fixed device in contact with the road surface.
   - **Construction Signs or Obstacles:** There are no obvious construction signs, fences, cones, or earth mounds visible in the image.

1. **Identify Large Stationary Vehicles:**
   - There is a yellow flatbed truck parked on the right side of the road. It is stationary and not moving normally.

2. **Determine if the Vehicle is in a Construction Operation State:**
   - The truck is parked near the road edge, and there are orange traffic cones placed around it, indicating a construction or maintenance activity.
   - The truck's flatbed is empty, and there is no visible tilting, unloading, or loading activity.
   - There is no digging arm, bucket, or mechanical arm in operation.
   - There are no visible signs of the vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device having physical contact with the road surface.
   - There are personnel near the truck, but they appear to be interacting with the truck rather than operating it or directing construction activities.

3. **Consider Construction Signs and Obstacles:**
   - The presence of traffic cones suggests that the area is being used for some form of road activity, possibly maintenance or inspection.

### Conclusion:
While the truck is stationary and there are traffic cones indicating some form of road activity, there is no clear evidence of road occupation or digging activities such as unloading, loading, digging, or mechanical arm operation. The personnel near the truck do not appear to be actively engaged in construction.

   - The image shows a road with a few visible signs. The most prominent sign is located on the left side of the road, near the sidewalk. It appears to be a white sign with some text on it.

2. **Extract Text Content:**
   - The text on the white sign is not clearly visible due to the resolution and angle of the image. It is difficult to determine the exact content of the sign.

3. **Determine Relevance:**
   - Since the text on the sign is not clearly visible, it is uncertain whether the content is related to ""public affairs"" or ""personal affairs."" Additionally, the sign does not appear to be a common road sign related to transportation or place names.

- **Vehicles**: All visible vehicles appear to be in normal driving or stationary positions. There are no visible items stacked on top of or within the vehicles.
  
- **Road Surface and Shoulders**: The road surface and shoulders do not show any items that are stacked or placed. The road appears clear of any such items.

- **Stacking Behavior**: There is no evidence of any items being stacked or placed on the road area.

### Result:

1. **Identify Large Stationary Vehicles:**
   - There is a large yellow vehicle on the bridge in the image. It appears to be a construction or maintenance vehicle.

2. **Determine if the Vehicle is in a Construction Operation State:**
   - The vehicle body is not tilted, and there is no visible unloading or loading activity.
   - There is no digging arm or bucket in operation.
   - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device does not appear to have physical contact with the road surface.
   - There are no obvious construction signs, fences, cones, or earth mounds indicating construction activity.
   - No personnel are visible interacting with the vehicle or directing any operation.

3. **Consider Interfering Content:**
   - The image is clear, and there are no obstructions or severe lack of light that would prevent accurate determination.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the large vehicle on the bridge does not appear to be engaged in road occupation or digging activities. It is stationary but not in a construction operation state.

    Task: Please analyze this image and determine if any vehicles are currently engaged in road occupation/digging activities.
    Firstly, you need to determine if there are any **large stationary vehicles** (such as construction trucks, engineering vehicles, excavators, etc.) in the image. Ignore vehicles that are moving normally or waiting to pass.
    Then, determine if these **stationary large vehicles** are in a construction operation state, including but not limited to:
    - The vehicle body is tilted, is unloading or loading;
    - The digging arm or bucket is in operation;
    - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device has physical contact with the road surface;
    - There are obvious construction signs or construction obstacles (such as fences, cones, earth mounds, etc.) that are in line with the construction behavior;
    - Personnel are interacting with the vehicle, operating it, or directing the operation. Ignore the following interfering content: normal vehicle movement, vehicle parked in a safe area but without construction activities, buildings, pedestrians, toll stations, dividers, etc.

1. **Identify Road Signs/Billboards:**  
   - The image shows a road with a few visible signs. The most prominent sign is located on the left side of the road near the sidewalk. It appears to be a small signboard with text on it. However, the text is not clearly legible due to the resolution and angle of the image.

2. **Determine the Nature of the Text:**  
   - The text on the signboard is not clearly visible, so it is difficult to determine whether it is related to ""public affairs"" or ""personal affairs."" Given the lack of clarity, it is safer to assume that the text is not related to any official or transportation-related matters.

3. **Consider the Context:**  
   - The signboard is located near a roadside stall, which suggests that it might be related to personal affairs such as an advertisement or a notice for the stall. However, due to the lack of clarity, it is not possible to confirm this.

### Conclusion:
Since the text on the signboard is not clearly visible and it is not possible to determine its nature, the safest response is to consider it unrelated to the task.

    Firstly, you need to determine if there are any **large stationary vehicles** (such as construction trucks, engineering vehicles, excavators, etc.) in the image. Ignore vehicles that are moving normally or waiting to pass.
    Then, determine if these **stationary large vehicles** are in a construction operation state, including but not limited to:
    - The vehicle body is tilted, is unloading or loading;
    - The digging arm or bucket is in operation;
    - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device has physical contact with the road surface;
    - There are obvious construction signs or construction obstacles (such as fences, cones, earth mounds, etc.) that are in line with the construction behavior;
    - Personnel are interacting with the vehicle, operating it, or directing the operation. Ignore the following interfering content: normal vehicle movement, vehicle parked in a safe area but without construction activities, buildings, pedestrians, toll stations, dividers, etc.
    If the image is blurry, the view is obstructed, or there is severe lack of light, making it impossible to accurately determine, please reply ""no"".

1. **Identify the Road Area**: The road area includes the lanes, crosswalks, and any other paved surfaces intended for vehicles and pedestrians. It does not include sidewalks, medians, or areas outside the road boundaries.

2. **Look for Stacked Items**: Focus on identifying any objects that are placed or stacked on the road surface. This excludes vehicles, pedestrians, guardrails, utility poles, and other typical road obstacles.

3. **Examine Vehicles**: Check if any items are stacked on or within the vehicles. If so, this does not count as stacking on the road.

4. **Check for Unclear Cases**: If there is any ambiguity about whether an item is stacked on the road, default to ""no"" to avoid incorrect judgment.

### Image Analysis:

- The image shows a road intersection with vehicles, including a large truck and a smaller vehicle.
- The truck is carrying a load that is secured on its trailer. This load is not on the road but on the vehicle.
- There are no visible items stacked directly on the road surface. All objects are either on vehicles or in designated areas.

### Conclusion:

There are no items piled up on the road or within the road area. All items are either on vehicles or in appropriate locations.

1. **Identify Road Signs or Billboards:**
   - The image shows a road with various elements, including trees, a sidewalk, and a small stall on the left side. There is a sign on the left side of the road near the stall, which is highlighted with a red bounding box.

2. **Extract Text Content:**
   - The sign within the red bounding box appears to be blank or has no visible text. The image does not provide any clear text content on the sign.

3. **Determine the Nature of the Text:**
   - Since there is no visible text on the sign, it is not possible to determine if the content is related to ""public affairs"" or ""personal affairs.""

4. **Consider the Context:**
   - The sign is located near a small stall, which might suggest it could be related to personal affairs. However, without any visible text, it is not possible to confirm this.

1. **Identify Large Stationary Vehicles:**
   - There is a large yellow vehicle (likely a construction or maintenance truck) parked on the right side of the road. It is stationary and not moving normally.

2. **Determine if the Vehicle is in a Construction Operation State:**
   - **Vehicle Body Tilt or Loading/Unloading:** The vehicle does not appear to be tilted, and there is no visible unloading or loading activity.
   - **Digging Arm or Bucket Operation:** There is no visible digging arm or bucket in operation.
   - **Mechanical Arm or Fixed Device Contact with Road Surface:** There is no visible mechanical arm or fixed device in contact with the road surface.
   - **Construction Signs or Obstacles:** There are several traffic cones placed around the vehicle, which are typical construction obstacles. This suggests a construction or maintenance activity.
   - **Personnel Interaction:** There are personnel near the vehicle, possibly interacting with it or directing the operation.

3. **Consider Interfering Content:**
   - The image is clear, and there are no obstructions or severe lack of light that would prevent accurate determination.

### Conclusion:
Based on the presence of traffic cones and personnel near the stationary vehicle, it can be inferred that the vehicle is engaged in a road occupation or maintenance activity.

    Firstly, you need to determine if there are any **large stationary vehicles** (such as construction trucks, engineering vehicles, excavators, etc.) in the image. Ignore vehicles that are moving normally or waiting to pass.
    Then, determine if these **stationary large vehicles** are in a construction operation state, including but not limited to:
    - The vehicle body is tilted, is unloading or loading;
    - The digging arm or bucket is in operation;
    - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device has physical contact with the road surface;
    - There are obvious construction signs or construction obstacles (such as fences, cones, earth mounds, etc.) that are in line with the construction behavior;
    - Personnel are interacting with the vehicle, operating it, or directing the operation. Ignore the following interfering content: normal vehicle movement, vehicle parked in a safe area but without construction activities, buildings, pedestrians, toll stations, dividers, etc.

   - There are no large stationary vehicles such as construction trucks, engineering vehicles, or excavators visible in the image. The vehicles present are regular cars and a van, none of which are large construction vehicles.

2. **Check for Construction Operation State:**
   - Since there are no large stationary vehicles, there is no need to check for construction operation states like unloading/loading, digging arms in operation, or mechanical arms contacting the road surface.

3. **Check for Construction Signs or Obstacles:**
   - There are some construction signs and barriers visible, but they are not associated with any large stationary construction vehicles. They appear to be part of a checkpoint or traffic control setup.

4. **Check for Personnel Interaction:**
   - There are no personnel interacting with any vehicles in a manner that suggests construction activities.

1. **Identify Large Stationary Vehicles:**
   - There is a large vehicle in the image, specifically a truck carrying an excavator. The truck appears to be stationary or moving very slowly.

2. **Determine if the Vehicle is in a Construction Operation State:**
   - **Vehicle Body Tilt/Unloading/Loading:** The truck is not tilted, and there is no visible unloading or loading activity.
   - **Digging Arm or Bucket Operation:** The excavator's arm and bucket are not in operation; they are in a resting position on the truck.
   - **Mechanical Arm/Road Contact:** There is no physical contact between the vehicle's mechanical arm or any fixed device and the road surface.
   - **Construction Signs/Obstacles:** There are no visible construction signs, fences, cones, or earth mounds that indicate construction activity.
   - **Personnel Interaction:** There are no visible personnel interacting with the vehicle or directing any operation.

3. **Consider Interfering Content:**
   - The image is clear, and there are no obstructions or severe lack of light that would prevent accurate determination.

    Task: Please analyze this image and determine if any vehicles are currently engaged in road occupation/digging activities.
    Firstly, you need to determine if there are any **large stationary vehicles** (such as construction trucks, engineering vehicles, excavators, etc.) in the image. Ignore vehicles that are moving normally or waiting to pass.
    Then, determine if these **stationary large vehicles** are in a construction operation state, including but not limited to:
    - The vehicle body is tilted, is unloading or loading;
    - The digging arm or bucket is in operation;
    - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device has physical contact with the road surface;
    - There are obvious construction signs or construction obstacles (such as fences, cones, earth mounds, etc.) that are in line with the construction behavior;
    - Personnel are interacting with the vehicle, operating it, or directing the operation. Ignore the following interfering content: normal vehicle movement, vehicle parked in a safe area but without construction activities, buildings, pedestrians, toll stations, dividers, etc.
    If the image is blurry, the view is obstructed, or there is severe lack of light, making it impossible to accurately determine, please reply ""no"".

    Firstly, you need to determine if there are any **large stationary vehicles** (such as construction trucks, engineering vehicles, excavators, etc.) in the image. Ignore vehicles that are moving normally or waiting to pass.
    Then, determine if these **stationary large vehicles** are in a construction operation state, including but not limited to:
    - The vehicle body is tilted, is unloading or loading;
    - The digging arm or bucket is in operation;
    - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device has physical contact with the road surface;
    - There are obvious construction signs or construction obstacles (such as fences, cones, earth mounds, etc.) that are in line with the construction behavior;
    - Personnel are interacting with the vehicle, operating it, or directing the operation. Ignore the following interfering content: normal vehicle movement, vehicle parked in a safe area but without construction activities, buildings, pedestrians, toll stations, dividers, etc.

1. **Image Overview**: The image shows a nighttime view of a road with a curved layout. The road is bordered by guardrails on both sides, and there are streetlights illuminating the area. The image is in black and white, which is typical for night vision cameras.

2. **Road Surface**: The road surface appears clear, with no visible vehicles, pedestrians, or large objects. There are some tire marks on the road, but these are not indicative of stacking or placing items.

3. **Guardrails and Surroundings**: The guardrails and surrounding areas do not show any signs of items being stacked or placed. The area appears to be free of debris or objects that could be considered as stacked items.

4. **Utility Poles and Other Structures**: There are no utility poles or other structures within the road area that could be mistaken for stacked items. The structures present are part of the road infrastructure.

5. **Potential Stacking Areas**: There are no areas within the road that suggest the act of stacking items. The road is clear and there are no indications of items being placed or stacked.

    Firstly, you need to determine if there are any **large stationary vehicles** (such as construction trucks, engineering vehicles, excavators, etc.) in the image. Ignore vehicles that are moving normally or waiting to pass.
    Then, determine if these **stationary large vehicles** are in a construction operation state, including but not limited to:
    - The vehicle body is tilted, is unloading or loading;
    - The digging arm or bucket is in operation;
    - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device has physical contact with the road surface;
    - There are obvious construction signs or construction obstacles (such as fences, cones, earth mounds, etc.) that are in line with the construction behavior;
    - Personnel are interacting with the vehicle, operating it, or directing the operation. Ignore the following interfering content: normal vehicle movement, vehicle parked in a safe area but without construction activities, buildings, pedestrians, toll stations, dividers, etc.
    If the image is blurry, the view is obstructed, or there is severe lack of light, making it impossible to accurately determine, please reply ""no"".

1. **Identify the Road Area**: The image shows a road with multiple lanes, a central divider, and pedestrian crossings. The road is well-lit, and the lanes are clearly marked.

2. **Look for Stacked Items**: 
   - Scan the entire road area for any objects that appear to be stacked or piled up.
   - Focus on the lanes, the central divider, and the pedestrian crossings.
   - Ensure that any identified objects are not vehicles, pedestrians, guardrails, utility poles, or road obstacles.

3. **Examine the Central Divider**: 
   - The central divider has a series of yellow and black reflective markers. These are standard road features and not considered stacked items.

4. **Check the Lanes and Crossings**: 
   - The lanes and pedestrian crossings are clear. There are no visible objects that appear to be stacked or piled up.

5. **Review the Surroundings**: 
   - The sidewalks and areas adjacent to the road do not show any items that could be considered as stacked on the road.

1. **Road and Vehicle Context**: The image shows a road with a white car driving on it. The road is marked with white dashed lines, and there are no visible pedestrians, utility poles, or road obstacles in the immediate area.

2. **Stacking Items on Road**: The focus is on identifying any items that are stacked or placed on the road. In this image, there are no visible objects or items that appear to be stacked on the road. The road surface is clear except for the car.

3. **Vehicle Context**: The white car is driving on the road, and there are no items stacked on or within the vehicle that are visible from this perspective. The car appears to be in motion and is not involved in any stacking activity.

4. **Guardrails and Other Structures**: The guardrails and other structures are part of the road infrastructure and do not constitute items being stacked on the road.

### Conclusion:

There are no items piled up on the road or within the road area in this image. The road is clear except for the car, and there is no evidence of stacking or placing items.

1. **Road and Sidewalk Area**: The image shows a road with clear lane markings and a sidewalk on the right side. The road is relatively empty, with no vehicles or pedestrians visible.

2. **Potential Stalls or Vendors**: On the right side of the image, there are structures that appear to be temporary or semi-permanent. These structures have red and white coverings, which could suggest stalls or booths. However, there are no visible signs of vendors or people actively engaging in selling activities.

3. **Presence of Vendors**: There are no individuals visible near the structures that could be identified as vendors. The absence of people actively selling or managing the stalls is a critical factor in determining if this is a roadside selling activity.

4. **Road Usage**: The structures are located on the sidewalk and not directly on the road. Therefore, they do not occupy the road area.

    Firstly, you need to determine if there are any **large stationary vehicles** (such as construction trucks, engineering vehicles, excavators, etc.) in the image. Ignore vehicles that are moving normally or waiting to pass.
    Then, determine if these **stationary large vehicles** are in a construction operation state, including but not limited to:
    - The vehicle body is tilted, is unloading or loading;
    - The digging arm or bucket is in operation;
    - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device has physical contact with the road surface;
    - There are obvious construction signs or construction obstacles (such as fences, cones, earth mounds, etc.) that are in line with the construction behavior;
    - Personnel are interacting with the vehicle, operating it, or directing the operation. Ignore the following interfering content: normal vehicle movement, vehicle parked in a safe area but without construction activities, buildings, pedestrians, toll stations, dividers, etc.
    If the image is blurry, the view is obstructed, or there is severe lack of light, making it impossible to accurately determine, please reply ""no"".

1. **Identify the Road Area**: The road area is clearly visible in the image, with a clear distinction between the road surface and the surrounding greenery and barriers.

2. **Look for Stacked Items**: Focus on identifying any items that are stacked or placed on the road surface. Items on vehicles, pedestrians, guardrails, utility poles, or road obstacles are not considered.

3. **Examine the Vehicles**: The image shows several trucks on the road. The trucks are carrying items, but these items are on the vehicles and not on the road surface.

4. **Check the Road Surface**: The road surface appears clear of any stacked items. There are no objects placed or stacked directly on the road.

### Conclusion:

There are no items piled up on the road or within the road area. All items are on vehicles.

1. **Identify Road Area**: The road area includes the lanes, sidewalks, and any other space within the road boundaries. Vehicles, guardrails, and utility poles are not considered as items being stacked.

2. **Look for Stacked Items**: Focus on identifying any objects that are placed or stacked on the road area. This includes items like boxes, bags, construction materials, or any other objects that are not part of the road infrastructure or vehicles.

3. **Check Vehicles**: If items are on a vehicle, they are not considered as being stacked on the road. Ensure that the items are not part of a vehicle's load.

4. **Check for Ambiguity**: If there is any uncertainty about whether an object is being stacked or not, return ""no"" to avoid incorrect judgment.

### Image Analysis:

- The image shows a road with vehicles, including a white car, a red truck, and a few other vehicles.
- There are no visible items stacked on the road itself. The road appears clear of any objects that are not part of the road infrastructure or vehicles.

1. **Identify Large Stationary Vehicles:**
   - There is a large red truck in the image that appears to be stationary. It is positioned on the road and is not moving normally.

2. **Determine if the Vehicle is in a Construction Operation State:**
   - **Vehicle Body Tilt/Unloading/Loading:** The truck does not appear to be tilted, and there is no visible unloading or loading activity.
   - **Digging Arm/Bucket Operation:** There is no visible digging arm or bucket in operation.
   - **Mechanical Arm/Fixed Device Contact:** There is no visible mechanical arm or fixed device in contact with the road surface.
   - **Construction Signs/Obstacles:** There are traffic cones present, which could indicate a construction zone or a road block. However, the cones are not directly associated with the truck.
   - **Personnel Interaction:** There are no visible personnel interacting with the vehicle or directing any operation.

3. **Consider Interfering Content:**
   - The image is clear, and there are no obstructions or severe lack of light that would prevent accurate determination.

### Conclusion:
The large red truck is stationary, but there is no clear evidence that it is engaged in road occupation or digging activities. The presence of traffic cones does not definitively indicate construction activity involving this vehicle.

1. **Identify Road Signs and Billboards:**
   - The image contains several road signs and a billboard. The road signs are circular and rectangular, while the billboard is rectangular and located on the right side of the road.

2. **Extract Text Content:**
   - The circular signs display ""49"" and ""14k,"" which likely indicate speed limits or other traffic-related information.
   - The rectangular sign on the right side of the road has text that is partially visible and appears to be related to transportation or public affairs.

3. **Determine the Nature of the Text:**
   - The text on the circular signs (""49"" and ""14k"") is clearly related to transportation, as they are common symbols used for speed limits or other traffic regulations.
   - The text on the rectangular sign appears to be related to public affairs, as it seems to provide information about transportation or road conditions.

4. **Check for Personal Affairs Vocabulary:**
   - There is no text that matches the vocabulary related to personal affairs such as ""Welcome to **,"" ""Advertisement of **,"" ""Car maintenance of **,"" or ""Recruitment of **.""

5. **Final Decision:**
   - Since the text on the signs is related to transportation and public affairs, the result should be ""no.""

    Task: Please analyze this image and determine if any vehicles are currently engaged in road occupation/digging activities.
    Firstly, you need to determine if there are any **large stationary vehicles** (such as construction trucks, engineering vehicles, excavators, etc.) in the image. Ignore vehicles that are moving normally or waiting to pass.
    Then, determine if these **stationary large vehicles** are in a construction operation state, including but not limited to:
    - The vehicle body is tilted, is unloading or loading;
    - The digging arm or bucket is in operation;
    - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device has physical contact with the road surface;
    - There are obvious construction signs or construction obstacles (such as fences, cones, earth mounds, etc.) that are in line with the construction behavior;
    - Personnel are interacting with the vehicle, operating it, or directing the operation. Ignore the following interfering content: normal vehicle movement, vehicle parked in a safe area but without construction activities, buildings, pedestrians, toll stations, dividers, etc.
    If the image is blurry, the view is obstructed, or there is severe lack of light, making it impossible to accurately determine, please reply ""no"".

    Task: Please analyze this image and determine if any vehicles are currently engaged in road occupation/digging activities.
    Firstly, you need to determine if there are any **large stationary vehicles** (such as construction trucks, engineering vehicles, excavators, etc.) in the image. Ignore vehicles that are moving normally or waiting to pass.
    Then, determine if these **stationary large vehicles** are in a construction operation state, including but not limited to:
    - The vehicle body is tilted, is unloading or loading;
    - The digging arm or bucket is in operation;
    - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device has physical contact with the road surface;
    - There are obvious construction signs or construction obstacles (such as fences, cones, earth mounds, etc.) that are in line with the construction behavior;
    - Personnel are interacting with the vehicle, operating it, or directing the operation. Ignore the following interfering content: normal vehicle movement, vehicle parked in a safe area but without construction activities, buildings, pedestrians, toll stations, dividers, etc.
    If the image is blurry, the view is obstructed, or there is severe lack of light, making it impossible to accurately determine, please reply ""no"".

1. **Identify the Road Area**: The road area is clearly visible in the image, with a clear distinction between the road and the surrounding areas. The road is bordered by guardrails and vegetation.

2. **Look for Stacked Items**: 
   - The image shows several trucks parked along the side of the road. The trucks are carrying items, but these items are on the trucks, not on the road itself.
   - There are no visible items stacked directly on the road surface. The road appears clear of any objects that are not part of the vehicles or road infrastructure.

3. **Consider the Context**: 
   - The trucks are parked in a designated area, likely a rest stop or a loading/unloading zone. The items on the trucks are secured and not spilling onto the road.
   - There are no signs of items being stacked or placed on the road outside of the vehicles.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, there are no items piled up on the road or within the road area. All items are either on the trucks or part of the road infrastructure.

   - The image shows a road with a few visible signs. The most prominent sign is located on the left side of the road, near the red box. It appears to be a small billboard or sign with some text and images. However, the text on this sign is not clearly legible due to the resolution and angle of the image.  
   - There are no other visible signs or billboards on the road itself.

2. **Determine Text Content and Relevance:**  
   - The text on the sign near the red box is not clearly readable, so it is uncertain whether it contains any relevant information.  
   - The text in the upper left corner of the image is an annotation and not part of a sign on the road, so it is ignored.

3. **Classification of Content:**  
   - Since the text on the sign is not clearly readable, it is not possible to determine if it is related to ""public affairs"" or ""personal affairs.""  
   - Therefore, the safest response is to consider it as not related to either category.

1. **Identify Large Stationary Vehicles:**
   - There are no large stationary vehicles visible in the image. The area appears to be clear of construction trucks, engineering vehicles, or excavators.

2. **Check for Construction Operation State:**
   - Since there are no large stationary vehicles, there is no need to check for any construction operation states such as unloading/loading, digging arms in operation, or mechanical arms contacting the road surface.

3. **Look for Construction Signs or Obstacles:**
   - There are some traffic cones and barriers visible on the left side of the road. However, these do not indicate active construction activity. They appear to be placed as a precaution or for traffic control.

4. **Check for Personnel Interaction:**
   - There are no visible personnel interacting with any vehicles or performing construction activities.

5. **Consider Interfering Content:**
   - The image is clear, and there are no obstructions or severe lack of light that would prevent accurate analysis.

### Conclusion:
There are no vehicles engaged in road occupation/digging activities in the image.

    Task: Please analyze this image and determine if any vehicles are currently engaged in road occupation/digging activities.
    Firstly, you need to determine if there are any **large stationary vehicles** (such as construction trucks, engineering vehicles, excavators, etc.) in the image. Ignore vehicles that are moving normally or waiting to pass.
    Then, determine if these **stationary large vehicles** are in a construction operation state, including but not limited to:
    - The vehicle body is tilted, is unloading or loading;
    - The digging arm or bucket is in operation;
    - The vehicle's mechanical arm or fixed device has physical contact with the road surface;
    - There are obvious construction signs or construction obstacles (such as fences, cones, earth mounds, etc.) that are in line with the construction behavior;
    - Personnel are interacting with the vehicle, operating it, or directing the operation. Ignore the following interfering content: normal vehicle movement, vehicle parked in a safe area but without construction activities, buildings, pedestrians, toll stations, dividers, etc.

1. **Identify Large Stationary Vehicles:**
   - There are no large stationary vehicles visible in the image. The scene primarily shows a road with barriers, a pedestrian, and some signage.

2. **Check for Construction Operation State:**
   - There are no vehicles with tilted bodies, unloading/loading activities, or mechanical arms in operation.
   - No digging arms, buckets, or mechanical arms are interacting with the road surface.
   - There are no obvious construction signs or obstacles that indicate construction activities.

3. **Check for Personnel Interaction:**
   - There is a person visible in the image, but they are not interacting with any vehicle or construction equipment.

4. **Consider Interfering Content:**
   - The image includes road barriers, a pedestrian, and signage, but none of these indicate road occupation or digging activities.

5. **Image Clarity and Lighting:**
   - The image is clear enough to determine the absence of construction activities.

1. **Identify Road Area**: The road area includes the lanes, sidewalks, and any other space within the road boundaries. Vehicles, pedestrians, and road infrastructure like guardrails and utility poles are excluded from consideration.

2. **Look for Stacked Items**: Focus on identifying any objects that appear to be stacked or placed on the road area. This includes items like boxes, bags, or other objects that are not part of the road infrastructure or vehicles.

3. **Check for Ambiguity**: If the object is on a vehicle or if it is unclear whether the object is stacked, return ""no"" to avoid incorrect judgment.

### Analysis:

- **Red Box 1 (Top Left)**: This area shows a building with a red light. There are no visible items stacked on the road.
- **Red Box 2 (Middle Left)**: This area shows a sidewalk and a road. There are no visible items stacked on the road.
- **Red Box 3 (Middle Right)**: This area shows a sidewalk and a road. There are no visible items stacked on the road.
- **Red Box 4 (Bottom Right)**: This area shows parked cars. There are no visible items stacked on the road.
